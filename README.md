# military-db-application-tkinter
This is my first attempt to create an open-source application for my course project during my first year of study in university.
 
TKinter GUI application for managing a database(txt file) of military.

The default and only available language is Ukrainian.

In order to run the application, you should install tkinter module via pip, git clone the repo and run main.py.

During the launch, you will be prompted to select a database file. If you don't have one, you should create a blank file and select it.
